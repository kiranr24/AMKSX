# Week 4 Mini Group Assignment
## Feeding the Future: Mapping Food Insecurity's Impact on Birth Outcomes In Los Angeles County
## [Proposal Link](https://github.com/kiranr24/AMKSX/blob/main/Group%20Assignments/readme.md)
### Roles:
- Ashley - Data Analyst
  - Identify datasets appropriate for the project
  - Makes graphics to accompany reports whenever needed
- Maya - Project Co-coordinator
  - Helps lead the team to make sure we are meeting deadlines + responsible for assessing logistics of assignments
  - Makes sure we are where we are supposed to be (assignments are fulfilling key components of assignments’ asks)
- Kiran - Project Co-coordinator
  - Data management & visualization lead
  - Maintains the GitHub repository and other files
  -Coordinates meeting times
- Savannah - Data Analyst
  - Conducts analysis and data management on sociodemographic variables across LA SPAs
  - Performs literature reviews of other GIS/food insecurity articles to understand what kind of variables to create
- Xander - Data Analyst
  - Produces data visualization
  - Performs literature and methods review
  - Assist with data cleaning
### Status update:
We’re feeling positive about the project overall! We consistently establish realistic deadlines and support each other in resolving coding challenges that arise. We communicate well on GroupMe and Zoom meetings where we voice concerns and ideas to further the project. 
### Data update:
1. Food Insecurity is a slightly challenging data point
    - Grocery access data is lacking for dense population areas, like DTLA towards Midcity, which we are assuming is due to the high amount of grocery stores in this area, therefore populations do not lack grocery access necessarily.
    - We are incorporating SNAP usage as another metric of food insecurity which gives us more information about the social determinants of food security as well as which communities are using said support systems from the county.
2. Fertility/Low Birth Weight Data
   - We have requested data from the Maternal and Infant Health Division of Tracking California, and are hoping to receive more detailed information about birth outcomes on a census tract basis.
   - We have percentile data about Low Birthweight from CalEnviroscreen but would like more detailed information.
   - We have also pulled fertility data for LA County from the Census using the 2022 ACS.
     - It is a massive dataset with many layers that need to be edited/combined down and is on a census tract basis.
3. Education Data
   - Data regarding education levels has been pulled from LA GeoHub describing High School Degree or above and Bachelors degree or above.
     - Tried to find a dataset that incorporated multiple levels of education in one dataset, but could only find these ones.
     - Datasets are providing useful insights. Able to see which SPAs have more education which we know contributes fertility outcomes.
4. Income Data
   - Data regarding median household income in LA county, pulled from LA GeoHub.
     - This will help illustrate financial disparities among SPAs and highlight additional hurdles that people face when attempting to secure nutritious food.
5. Transportation Data
   - Data from census is lacking for unemployed community members as census transportation data largely revolves around commutes to work.
### Concerns:
1. Major Concerns:
   - More complex visualizations and libraries can be challenging to teach to ourselves.
   - Many of us have little to none coding experience.
   - Timing can be a stressful factor as we have to make sure that we’re learning the materials fast enough to wrap up assignments.
2. Minor Concerns:
   - This is many of our first class in the Urban Planning department and although we have some familiarity with key concepts, there may be new topics introduced that we have never heard of before. 
   - We all have slightly different schedules so it might be a challenge for us to all meet at the same time.
