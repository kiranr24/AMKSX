## Our research question
What contributes to food security and associated health outcomes at the community level in Los Angeles (LA) County?

*Sub-questions to explore*
- Which communities are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity?
- How have disparities in food insecurity within LA County SPAs changed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic?  
- What are the demographics of the most vulnerable communities?
- What are the impacts of food insecurity on birth outcomes, specifically low birth weight?

## Why this is important, why does it matter, & what is at stake
Food insecurity has a significant negative impact on individuals, communities, and societies. Furthermore, food insecurity tends to greatly impact vulnerable populations such as communities of color and lower-income status. Given LA County’s vast and diverse population, it is crucial to understand which of the eight SPAs are most at risk for food insecurity and what supplementary variables might be attributed to those risks. By examining food insecurity in the most vulnerable communities, this research hopes to provide valuable insights into the challenges that these communities face and ensure evidence-based policymaking while improving public health and environmental sustainability.

## Spatial & Temporal Scope
During preliminary analysis, this project intends to explore food insecurity in all eight of LA county’s SPAs: Antelope Valley, San Fernando Valley, San Gabriel Valley, Metro, West, South, East, and South Bay. While it is important to look at LA County as a whole, this project specifically plans to focus on the top three SPAs that experience the highest levels of food insecurity to understand the barriers. From there, we hope to focus on communities that are the most affected within each SPA. In terms of a temporal scope, the project’s period is left (currently) determined by the time scale of the data we find. We are hoping to look at least 5-10 years of data and be able to incorporate data about the pandemic to see how that an affects food insecurity in the affected regions. 

## Data Sources 
*A preliminary list of data sources is as follows*
- CalFresh Cases (Census Tract) [Link](https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/b308cb7ebdc84d64963416a4a3f50683_0/explore?location=34.564300%2C-118.028953%2C8.94)
 
  
CalFresh, a federal program, offers financial assistance to low-income individuals and families with funds to purchase food. Utilizing this data offers a comprehensive view of tackling food insecurity in LA County by identifying at-risk communities requiring greater levels of assistance.  

- USDA Food Deserts [Link](https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/7fb7f906515a490486a173bdba086d1b_0/explore?location=34.580139%2C-117.871049%2C10.61)

The USDA Food Deserts data is a valuable tool as it highlights geographic areas with limited food access. It may also help us identify additional disparities such as access to reliable public transportation, affordable grocery stores, and farmers' markets. 

- Maternal and Infant Health [Link](https://trackingcalifornia.org/maternal-and-infant-health/what-is-maternal-and-infant-health)

Maternal and Infant Health data includes fertility rates and low-birth-weight data. Since access to nutritious food has been a factor in premature births and low birth weight, it could be useful in indicating health outcomes that are linked to food insecurity. 

- Low Birthweight [Link](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CFH/DMCAH/surveillance/Pages/Low-Birthweight.aspx)

This is data on the rates of low birth weight in California. This could be valuable to help indicate food insecurity within populations, for the same reasons as the Maternal and Infant Health data. 

- Median Income and AMI (Census Tract) [Link](https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/5455a5c504064c38b5ac9638d8580d92_0/explore?location=34.517261%2C-117.956678%2C9.00)

Median Income and AMI enhance our understanding of economic disparities in LA County. This provides context as to which regions in Los Angeles have a higher proportion of individuals living below the poverty line. Consequently, these individuals could face greater barriers to purchasing nutritious, high-quality food. 

- High School Graduate or Higher (Census Tract) [Link](https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/d1aeaa00288f481c81e2ad448d5ff341_7/explore?location=34.369025%2C-117.940287%2C9.00)

High School Graduate or Higher (Census Tract) looks at the education levels across LA County which is an informative indicator for food insecurity. This dataset is broken down by both FIPS and SPA region which provides detailed demographic context on the education level. 

## Scope of Project & Visualizations
We aim to depict socioeconomic stratifications amongst LA communities that have high food insecurity levels as well as interpolate impacts from the pandemic and how they both ultimately culminate in health impacts affecting future generations of Angelinos. Beyond heatmaps showing food insecurity across Los Angeles, we hope to also incorporate temporal layers depicting how food security rates have changed over time and affected aforementioned health outcomes. This then can highlight specifically impacted regions which can then be targeted for policy and resources. 

## Insights We Hope to Gain
Identifying what community-level factors contribute to food insecurity, including but not limited to public transit access, car ownership, employment levels, grocery store, and restaurant access can help shape what an equitable and food-secure neighborhood looks like. This in turn will aid urban designers to include features and aspects of the built environment that can produce healthy communities. Hopefully, this research will elucidate some of the co-benefits prioritizing transit infrastructure and sources of fresh produce in zoning and planning can produce for communities.
